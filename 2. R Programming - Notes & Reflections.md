## Overview of R, R data types and objects, reading and writing data

Working directory is essentially the folder and the path to that folder where all the work is currently happening. Find your working directory with `getwd()` function. It is important to know the working directory as data would be read or written from that directory.

`ls()` will list all objects in the working directory. `?ls` will open a window providing the list of all the objects in the environment i.e., working directory?.

Use *CTRL + L* To clear the console.


### Data Types - R Objects and Attributes

All things manifulated in R are called objects. R has five basic (atomic or low level) classes of objects namely *character*, *numerics*, *integer*, *complex*, and *logical*. 


#### Vectors

Most basic object in R is called a *vector* which contains objects of the same class, with the exception of a _list_ that can contain different classes within the same *vector*. 

Empthy *vectors* can be created using `vector()` function, which has two arguments; class and lenght of the vector. Another way to create a vector is `c()` where c can be thought of as concatenate. Attributes of an object can be access using `attributes()` function.

#### Coercion

If two different types of classes are merged in a vactor, R performs a kind of _coercion_ to define the class. *Character* class takes precedence on *numeric* or *logical*. Similarly, *numeric* takes precedence on *logical*.

```{r}
x <- c(1.7, "a")
class(x)

y <- c("a", TRUE)
class(y)

z <- c(8, TRUE)
class(z)
```

In addition to this implict coercion, explict coercion can be done using `as.numeric()` and `as.character(x)`.

## Loop functions, debugging tools

## Simulation, code profiling

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
